/**
 * Switch operators.
 * Operators that provide switches for streams
 * including a [Changeover] that submits tuples to
 * one of two output ports depending if the switch
 * is on or off.
 *
 * [ControlledSwitch] and [ControlledChangeover] are
 * switches whose state can be changed through control variables.
 * This allows disconnected operators within the same application
 * to control the state of switches. For example downstream
 * processing can change an upstream flow through a controlled switch.
